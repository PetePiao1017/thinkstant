PERSONAL PROJECT
Self-driving car software
This software is designed to interpret the data it receives and 
make decisions about how to navigate safely and efficiently.
My developed software has been distributed to fully self-driving 
cars as well as semi-autonomous cars, driving robots, and drones, 
bringing innovation self-driving software development and many 
benefits in the company.
Custom 3D model experience for a client
This 3D model was designed to be interactive and engaging, 
allowing users to explore the 3D model from different angles and 
perspectives. I incorporated audio and visual effects to enhance 
the user confidence. The end result was an immersive 3D model 
that allowed users to explore the model in an engaging way.
Ping pong ball rotation trajectory prediction machine 
learning model
This model is used to predict the trajectory of a ping pong ball 
when it is hit by a paddle. 
Especially, the model is used to generate realistic simulations of 
ping pong matches for training purposes.
AI powered Stock Price Prediction engine
I Implemented stock trend prediction using deep learning model.
The goal of the project was to create a system that could 
accurately predict stock prices based on historical data.
I deployed the model on GCP using Google App Engine.
This allowed me to make predictions in real-time with minimal 
latency.
Customer Personality Analysis with Machine Learning 
Model
I used Decision Trees, Clustering, Customize Neural Networks, 
and SVMs to analyze customer data such as purchasing power, 
demographics, and other behavioral data to identify customer 
personality traits.
Customer detection and Customer personality analysis 
system  in markets and stores by facial recognition.
This system would use facial recognition technology to identify 
customers as they entered the store, allowing for more accurate 
tracking of customer behavior.
And it also could analyze customer behavior in order to better 
understand their preferences and buying habits.
Whatsapp bot with NLP
This WhatsApp bot is a chatbot that is specifically designed to 
interact with users on the WhatsApp messaging platform. It is 
used to automate customer service tasks, provide information, 
and even complete transactions. This bot is powered by artificial 
intelligence and natural language processing technology, which 
allows them to understand user messages and respond in a 
meaningful way.
Online Shopping Store
This project involved creating a website that allowed customers 
to browse and purchase products from the store include a 
shopping cart, payment processing, and customer accounts.

MY DREAM
My dream is to make my family live happily.
And And I want that the artificial intelligence systems I develop 
actually bring benefits to people and are widely used in various 
fields.
I think artificial intelligence has yet to reveal its true self.
I will contribute to the development of artificial intelligence with 
my technology, and I want to see the future of artificial
intelligence.
